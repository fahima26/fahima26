## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Fahima, a current undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics. Iâ€™ve done a few small projects before, mostly for college or helping others out, but I never really shared anything online.

Now Iâ€™m trying to take things a bit more seriouslyâ€”starting to build beginner AI tools and put my work out there. I created this profile mainly for the ITRI Taiwan internship, but also to track my progress and learn in public.

Still figuring things out, but excited to grow.
